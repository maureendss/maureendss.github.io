*This website is still currently under construction.*


I am a PhD student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure & Université de Paris, under the supervision of [Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/) and [Guillaume Wisniewki](https://gw17.github.io/).


I am part of the [CoML](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html) (Cognitive Machine Learning) team at the [Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique](https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en) (LSCP), in the [Cognitive Science Department](https://cognition.ens.fr/en) (DEC) of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. I am also affiliated to the [Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/en) (LLF) at the Université de Paris.

My research focuses on __bilingual language acquisition__, from a __reverse engineering__ perspective. Briefly, it consists in constructing unsupervised models of cognitive behaviours, using the same input available to humans, as a way to draw hypothesis on the actual cognitive processes at stake. More information on this approach is described on the CoML team's website.

I am also currently a part of the committee for the [2021 Zero Resource Speech challenge](https://zerospeech.com/2021/index.html).


Previously, I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an MSc in Speech and Language Processing, and from City, University of London with a BSc in Psychology. I also worked as a speech recognition engineer, focusing on acoustic modelling, prior to starting my PhD.
