*This website is currently being built.*


I am a PhD student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure & Université de Paris, under the supervision of Emmanuel Dupoux and Guillaume Wisniewki.


I am poart of the CoML (Cognitive Machine Learning) team at the Laboratoire de Sciences Cognitives et Psycholinguistique (LSCP), in the Cognitive Department (DEC) of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. I am also affiliated to the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle (LLF) at the Université de Paris.

My research focuses on _bilingual language acquisition__, from a __reverse engineering__ perspective. Briefly, it consists in constructing unsupervised models of cognitive behaviours, using the same input available to humans, as a way to draw hypothesis on the actual cognitive processes at stake. More information on this approach is described on the CoML team's website.
