Teaching Assistant for the 2021 Language Processing and Acquisition course led by [Alex de Carvalho](http://www.lscp.net/persons/decarvalho/). I am also teaching three of the classes, on *Word Learning*, *Lexical access* and *Second Language Acquisition*.
The course is part of the [Cogmaster programme](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/) of the [Cognitive Science Department (DEC)](https://cognition.ens.fr/en), at the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en); and targets postgraduate students.
