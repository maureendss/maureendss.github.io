The language discrimination process in infants has been successfully modeled using i-vector based systems, with results replicating several experimental findings. Still, recent work found intriguing results regarding the difference between monolingual and mixed-language exposure on language discrimination tasks. We use two carefully designed datasets, with an additional “bilingual” condition on the i-vector model of language discrimination. Our results do not show any difference in the ability of discriminating languages between the three backgrounds, although we do replicate past observations that distant languages (English-Finnish) are easier to discriminate than close languages (English German). We do, however, find a strong effect of background when testing for the ability of the learner to automatically sort sentences in language clusters: bilingual background being generally harder than mixed that clustering is dominated by speakers information rather than by languages.
